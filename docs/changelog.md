# Changelog

### 2.0.0 - updates for Python 3.8+

- Modernized for Python 3.8+ support only.

### 1.10.4 - python 3.5 xdist bugfix

 - Fixed issue with `pytest-xdist` and python 3.5: `pathlib` objects were not properly handled by other stdlib modules in this python version. Fixed [#59](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/59)
 - Changed the layout

### 1.10.3 - xdist bugfix + lazy `pandas` loading

 - `pandas` is now only imported when used, to speed up boot time. Fixes [#49](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/49)

 - Fixed issue with latest `pytest`+`pytest-xdist` versions: `pytest_harvest_xdist_worker_dump` hook is now called correctly. Fixes [#48](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/48)

### 1.10.2 - CI/CD change

 - This is a technical release to validate that migration to Github Actions worked.

### 1.10.1 - Now supporting `::` in test ids

 - `get_session_synthesis_dct` now properly handles test ids where `::` is present in the id. This fix propagates to all `[module/session]_results_[dct/df]` fixtures, too. Fixes [#45](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/45)

### 1.10.0 - Fixed issue on old pytest

 - On pytest < 5.3, `lazy_value` parameters from `pytest-cases` were wrongly inserted in the `module_results_df` as integer instead of objects. Fixed [#43](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/43) thanks to new `pytest-cases` 2.3.0.

### 1.9.3 - Fixed support for doctests

 - Fixed issue with doctests. PR [#41](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/pull/41) by [@larsoner](https://github.com/larsoner)

### 1.9.2 - bugfix

 - Fixed issue sometimes happening when xdist is not installed. Fixed [#40](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/40)

### 1.9.1 - better packaging

 - packaging improvements: set the "universal wheel" flag to 1, and cleaned up the `setup.py`. In particular removed dependency to `six` for setup and added `py.typed` file, as well as set the `zip_safe` flag to False. Removed tests folder from package. Fixes [#38](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/38)


### 1.9.0 - better pytest-xdist support

When `pytest-xdist` is used to distribute tests, worker node results are automatically stored in a file at the end of their respective pytest session using pickle, in a temporary `.xdist_harvested/` folder. These results are automatically retrived and consolidated when any of the `get_[module/session]_results_[dct/df]` method is called from the master node. Finally, the temporary folder is deleted at the end of master node session. Fixes [#36](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/36)

New function `get_fixture_store(session)` to replace `FIXTURE_STORE`. It is robust to xdist distribution, hence preferred over direct use of `FIXTURE_STORE`.

### 1.8.0 - pytest-xdist compliance

 - For each of the `[module/session]_results_[dct/df]` fixtures, an equivalent `get_<fixture_name>(session, ...)` helper function is available. This allows users to access the same level of functionality than the fixture, in places where fixtures are not available (typically in a pytest hook such as the `pytest_sessionfinish` session finish hook). In addition the default `FIXTURE_STORE` is now a package variable, available directly or through the session-scoped `fixture_store` fixture. Fixed [#33](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/33) and [#34](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/34).

 - Added an example in the documentation on how to use with pytest-xdist. Fixes [#32](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/32)

### 1.7.4 - `pyproject.toml`

Added a `pyproject.toml` file.

### 1.7.3 - python 2 bugfix

Fixed issue happening with python 2 when `unicode_literals` are used in the parameters receiving string types. Fixed [#28](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/28)

### 1.7.2 - added `__version__` attribute

Added `__version__` attribute at package level.

### 1.7.1 - added `six` dependency

It was missing from `setup.py`.

### 1.7.0 - `@saved_fixture` supports all scopes

 * Session-scoped and Module-scoped fixtures are now supported by `@saved_fixture`. Fixes [#17](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/17).

 * Documentation: new [API reference](https://smarie.github.io/python-pytest-harvest/api_reference) page.

### 1.6.1 - Minor improvements

Renamed argument in `create_results_bag_fixture` to align with the name used in `saved_fixture` (`store` instead of `storage`)

Now using `decopatch` for decorator creation. `make_saved_fixture` can thus be removed, and `saved_fixture` simplified.

Now using latest `makefun>=1.5` so that `saved_fixture` create proper fixture wrappers, using `@makefun.wraps`.

### 1.6.0 - improved `@saved_fixture` + minor dependency change

Users can now use `@saved_fixture` to save not only the fixture, but also some views created from it. This is interesting if each fixture is huge but users just want to save small aspects of it (name, size, etc.). Fixed [#21](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/21).

Dependency to `decorator` has been dropped and replaced with `makefun`.

### 1.5.0 - Bug fixes concerning fixtures

The `fixture_store` fixture, provided by the plugin, does not have `autouse=True` anymore. Fixed [#20](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/20).

`get_all_pytest_fixture_names` now returns fixtures that are indirectly parametrized, as well as fixtures that are not parametrized. Fixed [#19](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/19).

### 1.4.3 - Better exceptions for `@saved_fixture`

Now raising a better exception if `@saved_fixture` is used on session- or module-scope fixtures. Fixes [#18](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/18)

### 1.4.2 - Fixed results bags in presence of steps (2)

Another import error was causing results bag to be saved incorrectly in presence of steps.

### 1.4.1 - Fixed results bags in presence of steps

Results bags are now compliant with `pytest-steps`: there are now one per step. This fixed [#16](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/16).

### 1.4.0 - Removed integration with `pytest_steps` in default fixtures

Integrating `pytest-steps` in default fixtures seemed like a bad idea because it led to automatic behaviour that could silently raise warnings. Let `pytest-steps` handle it on its side.

### 1.3.0 - Better integration with `pytest_steps` in default fixtures

Default fixtures `module_results_df` and `session_results_df` now automatically become multi-level indexed when pytest steps is installed and there are steps in the tests.

### 1.2.1 - Minor: new low-level API

New method `get_all_pytest_fixture_names` to list all fixture names used by items in a session.

### 1.2.0 - Added column in default dataframe synthesis fixtures

Fixtures `module_results_df` and `session_results_df` now contains the `'pytest_obj'` column.

### 1.1.0 - New default fixtures + fixture parameter names fix

Created 6 fixtures registered by default by the plugin. Fixed [#14](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/14):

 - `fixture_store` in an `OrderedDict` that can be used as a fixture store, typically in `@saved_fixture`.
 - `results_bag` is a `ResultsBag`-typed results bag.
 - `session_results_dct` and `module_results_dct` return a synthesis dictionary for all tests completed "so far", respectively in the session or module. They include
    contents from the default `fixture_store`, including `results_bag`.
 - `session_results_df` and `module_results_df` are the dataframe equivalents of `session_results_dct` and `module_results_dct`

The documentation has been updated so that users can get started more quickly by leveraging them.

In addition:

 - `get_session_synthesis_dct` can now take both a `session` or a `request` input. If a `request` is provided, the status of current item will be marked as 'pending', while not started items will be marked as 'unknown'.
 - fixed bug in `get_session_synthesis_dct`: fixture parameters and saved fixtures where overriding each other in the final dict in `flatten=True` mode. Now fixture parameters appear as `'<fixture_name>_param'`. Fixed [#15](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/15).
 - `@saved_fixture` can now be used without arguments. By default it will store fixtures in the default session-scoped `'fixture_store'` fixture.
 - `HARVEST_PREFIX` moved to `common.py` and is now exported at package level.


### 1.0.1 - Ordering bug fix

Fixed pytest ordering issue, by relying on [place_as](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4429). See [#18](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-steps/issues/18)

### 1.0.0 - new methods for pytest session analysis

New methods are provided to analyse pytest session results:
 - `filter_session_items(session, filter=None)` is the filtering method used behind several functions in this package - it can be used independently. `pytest_item_matches_filter` is the inner method used to test if a single item matches the filter.
 - `get_all_pytest_param_names(session, filter=None, filter_incomplete=False)` lists all unique parameter names used in pytest session items, with optional filtering capabilities. Fixes [#12](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/12)
 - `is_pytest_incomplete(item)`, `get_pytest_status(item)`, `get_pytest_param_names(item)` and `get_pytest_params(item)` allow users to analyse a specific item.


### 0.9.0 - `get_session_synthesis_dct`: filter bugfix + test id formatter

 * `get_session_synthesis_dct`:

   - `filter` now correctly handles class methods. Fixed [#11](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/11)
   - new `test_id_format` option to process test ids. Fixed [#9](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/9)

### 0.8.0 - Documentation + better filters in `get_session_synthesis_dct`

 * Documentation: added a section about creating the synthesis table from *inside* a test function (fixes [#4](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/4)). Also, added a link to a complete example file.

 * `get_session_synthesis_dct`: `filter` argument can now contain module names (fixed [#7](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/7)). Also now the function filters out incomplete tests by default. A new `filter_incomplete` argument can be used to display them again (fixed [#8](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/8)).

### 0.7.0 - Documentation + `get_session_synthesis_dct` improvements 2

 * Results bags do not measure execution time anymore since this is much less accurate than pytest duration. Fixes [#6](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/6)

 * `get_session_synthesis_dct` does not output the stage by stage details (setup/call/teardown) anymore by default, but a new option `status_details` allows users to enable them. Fixes [#5](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/5)

 * `get_session_synthesis_dct` has also 2 new options `durations_in_ms` and `pytest_prefix` to better control the output.

 * Improved documentation.

### 0.6.0 - `get_session_synthesis_dct` improvements

 * `get_session_synthesis_dct` now has a test object `filter`, a `flatten` option, and and can now take optional storage objects as input to create a fully merged dictionary. See `help(get_session_synthesis_dct)` for details. Fixes [#3](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/3).

### 0.5.1 - Fixed bug with pytest 2.x

 * Fixed [#2](https://github.com/smarie/python-pytest-harvest/issues/2).

### 0.5.0 - First public version

First version validated against the [data science benchmark pattern](https://smarie.github.io/pytest-patterns/) (yet to be published)

 * `get_session_synthesis_dct` method to collect various test information already available
 * `@saved_fixture` decorator supports both a variable or a fixture for the storage
 * `create_results_bag_fixture` to create results bags
 * Documentation
